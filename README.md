Electron integration for Remix

![demo screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Setup

Use degit to create a new project from the template.

```sh
npx degit itsMapleLeaf/remix-electron/template my-desktop-app
```

### Adding to an existing project

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i remix-electron electron @remix-run/dev @remix-run/node @remix-run/server-runtime react react-dom
```

Add a file at `desktop/main.js` to run the electron app. The `initRemix` function returns a url to load in the browser window.

```js
// desktop/main.js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron")
const { initRemix } = require("remix-electron")
const remixConfig = require("../remix.config")

let win
async function createWindow(url) {
  win = new BrowserWindow({ show: false })
  await win.loadURL(url)
  win.show()
}

app.on("ready", async () => {
  try {
    const url = await initRemix({ remixConfig })
    await createWindow(url)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
})
```

Now run `npx electron desktop/main.js` to start the app! ðŸš€

## Using Electron APIs

Importing `"electron"` directly in route files results in Electron trying to get bundled and called in the browser / renderer process.

To circumvent this, create a `electron.server.js` file, which re-exports from electron. The `.server` suffix tells Remix to only load it in the main process. You should use `.server` for any code that runs in the main process and uses node/electron APIs.

```js
// app/electron.server.js
export * from "electron"
```

> **Note for TypeScript users:** The way that the Electron definitions are written doesn't let you do this in a .ts file. Instead, add this `.d.ts` file next to the `.js` file:
>
> ```ts
> // app/electron.server.d.ts
> import * as electron from "electron"
> export = electron
> ```

Likewise, for any code running in the renderer process, e.g. using the [clipboard](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/clipboard) module, you can use the `.client` suffix. Renderer process modules require `nodeIntegration`.

```js
// desktop/main.js
let win
function createWindow() {
  // ...
  win = new BrowserWindow({
    // ...
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
    },
  })
}
```

## API

### `initRemix({ remixConfig[, mode] })`

Initializes remix-electron. Returns a promise with a url to load in the browser window.

Options:

- `remixConfig`: The remix config object. Require it from `remix.config.js`.

- `mode`: The mode the app is running in. Can be `"development"` or `"production"`. Defaults to `"production"` when packaged, otherwise uses `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

## Motivation

Electron has [a comprehensive list of security recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security) to follow when building an app, especially if that app interacts with the web. Which includes, but is not limited to:

- Using `preload.js` files to expose specific electron functionality to your app, via globals
- Using IPC communication
- Avoiding `remote.require` (which has since been removed)

These practices can lead to a lot of awkward boilerplate and splitting up related code across multiple files and domains.

With `remix-electron`, you can freely use Electron APIs in Remix loader functions. It's a Node process with full Node capabilities, with access to the full Electron API, none of which runs in the browser.

The browser only receives data and renders a view. Additionally, you can neatly colocate your main process code right beside the related renderer code in a route file.

Thinking about it another way: it's like a normal Remix web app, except Electron is your backend.
